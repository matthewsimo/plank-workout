## five minute plank workout

An angular app for an interactive plank workout.


Development requires `npm`, `grunt`, & `bower`.

- after you've checked the repo out, `cd` in
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- run `grunt`
- edit!

Note, angular doesn't like being run without a webserver, so you'll probably want to use something like <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/nws">nws</a>.
