## five minute plank workout

An angular app for an interactive plank workout.


Development requires `npm`, `grunt`, & `bower`.

- after you've checked the repo out, `cd` in
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- run `grunt`
- edit!

Note, angular doesn't like being run without a webserver, so you'll probably want to use something like <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/nws">nws</a>.

In an effort to mix up my work day and get fit this year, I came across the <a href="http://neilarey.com/workouts/five-minute-plank-workout.html">5 minute plank workout</a> by <a href="http://neilarey.com/">Neila Rey</a>.

I built this as a tool for me, but I hope you find it useful too! All credit should go to her for creation of this routine, I just added an interactive element to it.
